      Creamy GelatoGelato is a traditional Italian frozen dessert characterized
      by its dense, creamy, and smooth texture, resulting from a lower fat
      content (4%–9%) and slower churning process that incorporates less air
      compared to ice cream. It typically features more milk than cream, minimal
      to no egg yolks, and is served at a slightly warmer temperature (around
      -12°C) to enhance its intense flavor profile. Key Characteristics of
      Creamy Gelato: Ingredients: Primarily made from whole milk, sugar, and
      natural flavorings (nuts, fruit, chocolate), with much less cream and fat
      than American-style ice cream. Texture & Density: Because it is churned
      slowly, it has a low "overrun" (amount of air), often only 15%–35% air,
      making it very dense. Serving Temperature: Served warmer than traditional
      ice cream (approx. 10–22°F or -12 to -3°C), which keeps it soft, silky,
      and allows flavors to be more direct. Flavor Intensity: Lower fat content
      (4-9% vs 10-25% in ice cream) means the palate is not coated in fat,
      allowing flavors to taste brighter and more intense. Fat Content: Contains
      4–9% butterfat, which is significantly lower than the 10%–22% fat found in
      most ice creams.

      Soft serve is a smoother, less dense, and softer variety of ice cream,
      popularized in the late 1930s. Unlike traditional ice cream, it contains
      less milk fat and is served at higher temperatures directly from a
      specialized, continuously churning machine that incorporates air into the
      mix. Common at fast-food restaurants and fairs, it is rarely sold
      prepackaged. Key Characteristics and Information: Production: A
      specialized machine keeps a pre-mixed liquid base at a low, non-frozen
      temperature, freezing it instantly upon dispensing.Ingredients: Common
      components include milk, sugar, cream, and stabilizers like cellulose gum
      or carrageenan to maintain a smooth, creamy texture.Difference from Ice
      Cream: Soft serve generally contains less butterfat (\(3\%-6\%\)) compared
      to hard-packed ice cream (\(10\%-18\%\)) and has a higher percentage of
      air added during the freezing process.History: Developed in the 1930s,
      with Tom Carvel in 1934 being one of the pioneers who sold melted ice
      cream from a broken-down truck.Variants: Often vanilla or chocolate, but
      machines can produce flavored, water-based, or yogurt-based soft serve.
